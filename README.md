# 🏴‍☠️ Freedom Tower Project

> **Technology was meant to set you free — not lock you down.**

Freedom Tower is a decentralized initiative dedicated to reclaiming personal sovereignty through open-source tools, transparent knowledge, and resilient digital infrastructure.

We are not a company.  
We are not a brand.  
We are not a product.

We are a movement.

# 📜 Why Freedom Tower Exists

In a world increasingly controlled by centralized platforms, Freedom Tower was created to give individuals the power to build, create, and share **without permission**.

We believe:

- You should own your own data.
- You should host your own systems.
- You should share knowledge freely and openly.
- You should never be at the mercy of one platform, one provider, or one company.

Freedom Tower provides:

- **Starter Kits** for setting up your own personal servers and digital systems
- **Step-by-step Guides** for beginners and experts alike
- **Cheat Sheets** for navigating Git, GitHub, and decentralization technologies
- **Training Modules** to help anyone become their own digital sovereign
- **Blueprints** for redundancy, mirroring, and long-term resilience
